# VBA Stock Market Analysis Challenge

Welcome to the VBA Stock Market Analysis Challenge! This project demonstrates my ability to leverage VBA scripting to analyze stock market data efficiently across multiple quarters. The script is designed to automate the analysis process, allowing for quick retrieval and computation of key metrics for any given dataset.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing stock market data provided in Excel sheets. The VBA script created for this project loops through all the stocks in each quarter and outputs essential information such as ticker symbols, quarterly changes, percentage changes, and total stock volumes. Additionally, the script identifies and highlights the stocks with the greatest percentage increase, the greatest percentage decrease, and the greatest total volume. This automation simplifies the otherwise tedious process of manual data analysis in Excel.

## Features

- **Ticker Symbol Identification:** The script accurately identifies and processes each stock's ticker symbol within the dataset.
- **Quarterly and Percentage Changes:** Calculates the quarterly change in stock price (from the opening to closing price) and the percentage change.
- **Total Stock Volume Calculation:** Aggregates the total volume of each stock over the quarter.
- **Conditional Formatting:** Applies conditional formatting to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red, making the results visually intuitive.
- **Greatest Stock Metrics:** Automatically identifies the stock with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.
- **Multi-Sheet Functionality:** The script is designed to run across all sheets in the workbook, enabling seamless analysis of multiple quarters in one go.
